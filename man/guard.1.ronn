guard(1) -- Guard keeps an eye on your file modifications.
========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

Guard is a command line tool to easily handle events on file system modifications.

## SYNOPSIS

`guard <COMMAND> <OPTIONS>`

## COMMANDS

### start

Starts Guard. This is the default command if none is provided.

The following options are available:

`-c`, `--clear`
  Clears the Shell after each change.

`-n`, `--notify` <FLAG>
  Disable notifications (Growl or Libnotify depending on your system).
  Notifications can be disabled globally by setting a GUARD_NOTIFY environment variable to false.
  FLAG can be `true`/`false` or `t`/`f`.

`-d`, `--debug`
  Runs Guard in debug mode.

`-g`, `--group` <GROUP1> <GROUP2>...
  Runs only the groups specified by GROUP1, GROUP2 etc.
  Groups name should be separated by spaces.
  Guards that don't belong to a group are considered global and are always run.

`-w`, `--watchdir` <PATH>
  Tells Guard to watch PATH instead of `./`.

`-G`, `--guardfile` <FILE>
  Tells Guard to use FILE as its Guardfile instead of `./Guardfile` or `~/.Guardfile`.

`-i`, `--no-interactions`
  Turn off completely any Guard terminal interactions.

`-B`, `--no-bundler-warning`
  Turn off warning when Bundler is not present.

`--show-deprecations`
  Turn on deprecation warnings.

`-l`, `--latency`
  Overwrite Listen's default latency.

`-p`, `--force-polling`
  Force usage of the Listen polling listener.

### init [GUARDS]

If no Guardfile is present in the current directory, creates an empty Guardfile.

If <GUARDS> are present, add their default Guardfile configuration to the current Guardfile.
Note that <GUARDS> is a list of the Guard plugin names without the `guard-` prefix.
For instance to initialize guard-rspec, run `guard init rspec`.

### list

Lists Guard plugins that can be used with the `init` command.

### -T, show

List defined groups and Guard plugins for the current Guardfile.

### -h, help [COMMAND]

List all of Guard's available commands.

If <COMMAND> is given, displays a specific help for <TASK>.

## EXAMPLES

Initialize Guard and a specific Guard plugin at the same time:

`[bundle exec] guard init [rspec]`

Run Guard:

`[bundle exec] guard [start] --watchdir ~/dev --guardfile ~/env/Guardfile --clear --group backend frontend --notify false --debug`

or in a more concise way:

`[bundle exec] guard [start] -w ~/dev -G ~/env/Guardfile -c -g backend frontend -n f -d`
